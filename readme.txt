So far, I've only been able to follow along with the setup documents and I haven't been able to 
focus on this progress as much compared to my first projects. Workload has been tough
and I plan organizing my schedule to better commit to this project along with my other finals.

The Video has all the scenes completed from the setup documents and i plan on catching up on thihs and 2D this weekend.
